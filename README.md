# Iron Lady – Internal Lead Management System

## Project Overview
This project is an **Internal Business Automation Solution** built as part of the AI & Technology Intern assignment (Task 2).

Iron Lady receives learner enquiries from multiple sources such as websites, social media platforms, and referrals. Managing these enquiries manually can be time-consuming and inefficient. This application provides a centralized system to manage learner leads effectively.

---

## Problem Statement
- Learner leads are tracked manually using spreadsheets or messages  
- Follow-ups require repetitive manual effort  
- No centralized dashboard to track lead status  
- High chance of missed or delayed responses  

---

## Solution
A web-based **Internal Lead Management System** that helps the internal operations team to:
- Manage learner enquiries in one place  
- Track and update lead status  
- Edit and delete learner details  
- Generate AI-assisted follow-up messages  

This solution reduces manual work and improves operational efficiency.

---

## Features
- Add new learner leads  
- View all leads in a centralized dashboard  
- Update lead status (New, Contacted, Follow-up, Enrolled)  
- Edit lead details  
- Delete invalid or duplicate leads  
- AI-based follow-up message generation  

---

## CRUD Implementation
The application demonstrates a complete CRUD flow:

- **Create**: Add a new learner lead  
- **Read**: View all leads in the dashboard  
- **Update**: Edit lead details and update lead status  
- **Delete**: Remove a lead from the system  

---

## AI Usage
AI is used to generate contextual and professional follow-up messages based on learner details and current lead status.

This helps to:
- Reduce manual typing effort  
- Improve communication consistency  
- Save time for the operations team  

---

## Business Workflow
1. Learner enquiry is received  
2. Lead is added to the system  
3. Lead status is updated during follow-ups  
4. AI generates a follow-up message  
5. Lead is marked as enrolled or removed  

---

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- AI: Simulated AI logic for follow-up message generation  
- Storage: In-memory (frontend-based prototype)

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the `frontend` folder  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
4. Start adding and managing learner leads

## Note
This project is a functional prototype created to demonstrate business workflow, CRUD functionality, and AI usage as required for the assignment. Backend persistence can be added in a production-level implementation.
