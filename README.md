# Iron Lady – Internal Lead Management System

## Project Overview
This project is an **Internal Business Automation Solution** designed for **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** as part of the AI & Technology Intern assignment (Task 2).

Iron Lady receives learner enquiries from multiple sources such as websites, social media platforms, and referrals. Managing these enquiries manually can lead to inefficiencies, missed follow-ups, and increased operational effort.

This application provides a simple, centralized system to manage learner leads effectively.

---

## Problem Statement
- Learner leads are tracked manually using spreadsheets or messages  
- Follow-ups require repetitive manual effort  
- No centralized dashboard to track lead status  
- High chance of missing or delaying responses  

---

## Solution
An internal **web-based Lead Management System** that helps Iron Lady’s internal operations team to:
- Track learner enquiries in one place  
- Update lead status dynamically  
- Edit and manage learner details  
- Generate AI-assisted follow-up messages  

This solution reduces manual work and improves operational efficiency.

---

## Features
- Add new learner leads  
- View all leads in a centralized dashboard  
- Update lead status (New, Contacted, Follow-up, Enrolled)  
- Edit lead details  
- Delete invalid or duplicate leads  
- AI-based follow-up message generation  

---

## CRUD Implementation
This application demonstrates a complete CRUD flow:

- **Create**: Add a new learner lead  
- **Read**: View all leads in the dashboard  
- **Update**: Edit lead details and update lead status  
- **Delete**: Remove a lead from the system  

---

## AI Usage
AI is used to generate contextual and professional follow-up messages based on learner details and status.

This helps:
- Reduce manual typing effort  
- Improve response consistency  
- Save time for the operations team  

---

## Business Workflow
1. Learner enquiry received  
2. Lead added to the system  
3. Lead status updated during follow-ups  
4. AI-generated follow-up message sent  
5. Lead marked as enrolled or removed
